1. Get method: get data from server to client, to config "/trangchu" for website.
2. POST method: send data to server
3. nodemon: a npm module, use for auto reloading server
4. Database: can use for store data, I use `lowdb`- a npm module.
5. Express Router: seperate website into topics ==> index.js: short. 
6. Controller: put every get mothod, post method from "index.js" to "controller" ==> index is so clear.
7. Template inheritance: inherit layout from 1 layout.
